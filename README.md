# Interactive-React-Portfolio

## Description 
#### The purpose of this project was to build a front end portfolio website to showcase my projects. 




#### This was a fun but challenging project. Using REACT is a game changer, instead of putting all your eggs in one basket, you can create components. This helped me as I worked through my website. A lot of research and long hours took place, maybe because I am new but I look forward to improving my UI development skills. I would eventually come back to this project to create a more enhance UI, adding more animation and cool features as users view my page.
